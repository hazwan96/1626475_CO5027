        Now who says being new is a disadvantage? To validate that, our brand also won The World&#39;s SMEs Best Brands Award (Non PLC) for 2013 &amp; 2014 by The Brand Laureate and Most Recognized Brand in Casual Footwear Excellence in ASEAN Outstanding Business Award 2016. Therefore, at Fipper we believe that our &#39;newness&#39; at shoemaking gives us the freedom to dream. To see footwear with fresh eyes - and deliver equal parts fun, fearlessness and functionality. </p>
